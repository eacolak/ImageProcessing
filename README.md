# Image Processing
I started developing my skills in image processing during my first internship, and I am still actively improving in this field. Through small projects and lessons, I am expanding my knowledge in image segmentation, edge detection, and object recognition. I am applying practical implementations using popular libraries like OpenCV and TensorFlow.

Throughout my internship, I have been learning to apply machine learning and deep learning techniques to image processing problems. I am gaining experience in preparing datasets, training models, and evaluating results. For example, I am working on face recognition projects using Python's match statement to classify faces by their colors. These projects help me translate theoretical knowledge into practice and enhance my problem-solving skills.

By developing my skills in image processing, I am acquiring the knowledge and capabilities to keep up with new technologies and trends in this field. This will enable me to contribute to more complex projects and advance my professional career. To document my progress and share my work, I have created a GitHub repository and am enriching my GitHub profile.
